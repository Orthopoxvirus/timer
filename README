Timer

Timer is a simple time-tracking application written in HTML and JavaScript that
uses HTML5 DOM Storage to store all data completely on the client-side. It
allows you to track time spent working on multiple projects.

Timer is quite simplistic and it does not offer anything new or unique--it was
written mainly as an exercise to explore the state of the DOM Storage technology
in various browsers and MVC architecture in a pure JavaScript application.

Installation and Usage
----------------------
1. Download the ZIP or .tar.gz file of the Timer application from GitHub and
   extract it somewhere.
2. Open the timer.html file in your browser.
3. Happily use the application.

Note: In Firefox, the timer.html file cannot be accessed through a file: URL,
because the DOM Storage wouldn't work correctly then. The workaround is to move
the application into a directory served by a web server (either local or remote)
and access the timer.html file via http: URL. If someone knows how to make the
DOM Storage work with file: URLs in Firefox, please let me know.

Tip: For the best experience, save the timer.html URL into the bookmarks and
configure it to open in the browser sidebar.

Browser support
---------------
* IE 8+ (tested with RC1)
* Firefox 3+ (2.x versions should theoretically work too)
* Safari 4+ (tested with public beta)

Other browsers are not supported because they do not support DOM Storage.
